The <b><i>Pony One Piece</i></b> (previously the One-Piece Pony Figure) was the first piece and initial planned design for the horse figures, being just a singular piece with no articulation. The piece would last from August 3rd to August 22nd, 2024.

<h2>Production</h2>
The figure would begin development on August 2nd, 2024. The initial sculpt would be made, alongside an early iteration for eyes- which featured a large 3D shape. This would then be swapped out for a carved out hole to represent a smaller- simpler pupil. After this iteration was deemed a better fit for the look, multiple iterations that adjusted the pupil size and size of the smile would go through before the figure would be done.

The initial plans for hair would be to have it printed on the model through the use of bridging- where the completed print would be encased in a cone that would need to be carved out. Once carved, users would shape the hairs with a heat gun. This was based off of the 2016 3D print "Hairy Lion" which used the same technique.<sup>(1)</sup> This idea would later be scrapped for standard hair and tail pieces.

The figure would last until August 22nd, 2024, where it would be split into a body and hair piece for further articulation.

On June 17th, 2025, the piece would resurface under the current pony design, now being an easier alternative to printing ponies rather than the articulated version.
