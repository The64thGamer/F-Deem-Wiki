In those months, waiting for just this day, you were sure to read up everything your comrades and organizers handed out. Many were antique books on strange concepts long since obsolete.

Looking at this flower... You remember a heavy, dense textbook, ''D'Abo and Oldham's Guides and Travels on the Concept of Contextual Reality"

You rarely had chances to put it into practice. Not every object was as fit-together as they looked here. This strange flower- if you thought about it, the yellow tip looks sort of like a pickaxe handle upside-down. Maybe also a banana with a hole in it.

With a Contextual Reality mindset... your perception of objects describes what they truly are. If you could find a handle for this flower, it would become a yellow pick.
