<h2>Description</h2>
Initial working codebase, no visuals- just consoles with inputting commands. You can host and join servers, chat, change names, have the host change player permissions, and admins (host or players set by host as admin) can place "pieces" into the world (though only on the server is it viewable).

Just a barebones structure to get things working. Focusing on the backend before starting on visuals or gameplay will help immensely later. Next version should feature pinging servers, player uptime, and initialization of players into a world. Eventually we'll get to visualization and world saving.
