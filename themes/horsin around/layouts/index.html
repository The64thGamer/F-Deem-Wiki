		Fâ€™Deem is a 3D Printable Pony-Inhabited Building System.

		F'Deem pieces are built from scratch, designed to be mostly solid for strength. All of the base bricks are designed to print without supports, though figures and special pieces may require them. Bricks are at 1.5x the usual scale of other building systems for easier tolerances, strength, and to mimic the relative size of how bricks were when kids played with them.
		<br>
		Pieces are designed to be printed in 1 color, letting it be easily be made on any printer. Instead of going for stickers, F'Deem bricks have thick walls that allow them to be etched and debossed in the modeling software to form specific designs.
