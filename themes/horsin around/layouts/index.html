		Fâ€™Deem is a 3D Printable Pony-Inhabited Building System.
		<br><br>
		Welcome to the site! Everything is early in development, but a variety of printable pieces are available for you to try out! <a href="https://github.com/The64thGamer/F-Deem" class="navbar-brand">F'Deem is fully open source and remixable</a>, so customize it to your liking! Created by <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/the-64th-gamer" class="navbar-brand">The 64th Gamer</a>.

		<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
		<h3>What's the Design Philosophy?</h3>
		<br><br>
		Pieces are built from scratch, designed to be mostly solid for strength. All of the base bricks are designed to print without supports, though figures and special pieces may require them. Bricks are at 1.5x the usual scale of other building systems for easier tolerances, strength, and to mimic the relative size of how bricks were when kids played with them.
		<br>
		Pieces are designed to be printed in 1 color, letting it be easily be made on any printer. Instead of going for stickers, F'Deem bricks have thick walls that allow them to be etched and debossed in the modeling software to form specific designs.
		<br><br>
		<h3>What's the Roadmap?</h3>
		<br><br>
		Two sets are planned to be on the site currently, one based on Benchy3D and one based off Boaty3D. It'll take a bit to design the digital instructions. I originally had an idea to allow you to swap the palette of a set to be based on whatever colors you want to print with, but I may just do traditional instructions until that's more feasible.
		<br>
		Current piece ideas are obviously more pony hats and hair. There are also plans for small flag pieces you can form together with different colors to make a full flag, alongside some emoji 1x1 bricks. Eventually I'll also get to things the ponies can hold.
